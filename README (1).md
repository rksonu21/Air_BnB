Both hosts and guests can use the results to help them decide where to list or reserve Airbnb properties.

## Objectives:
• Recognize how Airbnb listings are distributed according to area, price range, type of room, and other relevant variables.

• Determine the most popular neighborhoods and Airbnb listing kinds.

• Examine the connection between occupancy rates and Airbnb prices.

• Provide information that will help hosts and guests have a better Airbnb experience.

## Methodology

The project explores and visualizes the Airbnb reservations data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) methodologies. To find patterns and trends, EDA involves examining and purifying data.

The EDA makes use of the Python libraries listed below:

**Pandas**: for analyzing and manipulating data

**Numpy**: For numerical computation, use numpy.

**Matplotlib**: a tool for visualizing data

**Seaborn**: for visualizing statistical data

## Insights

The project's conclusions offer insightful information on the New York City Airbnb market. These insights might help Airbnb owners decide how much to charge for their apartments and where to market them. These insights can help Airbnb users make well-informed choices about where to reserve their lodging.

For instance, Manhattan Airbnb hosts would want to think about listing their homes in tourist and business-friendly areas like Tribeca, SoHo, or Greenwich Village. Brooklyn Airbnb hosts would wish to think about offering their homes in tourist-friendly, more reasonably priced neighborhoods like Williamsburg, Park Slope, or DUMBO.

If you're searching for a reasonably priced and conveniently placed place to stay, you might wish to reserve an Airbnb in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Those who are searching for a more private and roomy lodging option might wish to think about renting a whole house or townhouse.

## Impact:

The results of the experiment can be applied to enhance both hosts' and visitors' Airbnb experiences. The results, for instance, might be used by Airbnb hosts to improve their pricing policies and draw in more visitors. The results can be used by Airbnb users to identify the ideal lodging options for their requirements and price range.

## Conclusion:

This project offers a useful examination of New York City's Airbnb booking data. Both hosts and guests can use the results to help them decide where to list or reserve Airbnb properties. There are other ways the project could be expanded to offer even more information about the Airbnb business.
